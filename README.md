# web3 playground (vue2) 

This is an experimental project to work on web3 based frontend applications.
It was really hard to start development, I think it took about 3-4 days for me to figure out how to get things work with Vue,
how and where should I begin. Guides on internet was not so clear and updated. This repository will contain base blocks to work with.
